            (I personally use Push Pull Legs repeate)</b>
    </h4>
    <h2><i>Golf and Football</i></h2>
    <h4><b>Fun fact, I have never broke 80 on 18 holes of golf! I have shot 80 three times but never 79. </b></h4>
    <h2><i>Reading</i></h2>
    <h4><b>Right now I am reading <i>Atomic Habbits</i> I have read many other books, a few are <i>Think and Grow
                Rich</i> by <i>Napoleon Hill</i>, <i>The Daily Law</i>, <b>AND</b> <i> The 48 Laws of Power</i> both
            written
            by
            <i>Robert Green.</i></b></h4>
    <h2><i>Cooking</i></h2>
    <h4><b>My favorite meal to eat is <i>Chicken Alfredo</i></b></h4>
    <h2><i>Cards and Boardgames</i></h2>
    <h4><b>I love to play chess, my elo is about 800. Play me if you want!</b> <a href="play.chess.com/SHrVo">Play
            me! </a>
        <h2><i>Strategic Video Games</i></h2>
        <h4><b>My games have always been strategic games. Single player games include <a
                    href="https://rimworldgame.com/">Rimworld</a>, and similar city builders. Puzzle solving games
                like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/210970/The_Witness/">The Witness</a>The Witness. I
                also really like shooters like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/221100/DayZ/">DayZ</a> or
                <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/">Escape from Tarkov</a>.</b></h4>
        <h2><i>Alternate Timeline Videos</i></h2>
        <h4></i>When I say alternative timeline videos I mean something like "What would
            happen if the asteroid that wiped out all life on Earth hit 10 minutes later". Channels like
            <i>RealLifeLore</i>, <i>AlternativeHistoryHub</i>, and <i>The Infographics Show</i>.
        </h4>
        <h2><i>Non-Fiction and Action Movies</i></h2>
        <h4>When I say non-fiction I don't mean a biography, more so a realistic movie that is not way over the top in
            terms of realism. I have way too many to name, it is actually too hard! </h4>
