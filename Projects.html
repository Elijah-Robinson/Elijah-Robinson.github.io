    <h1>My Projects</h1>
    <h2>Work Related</h2>
    <h3>At WWT (World Wide Technology) myself and 6 other interns built a system for GET, (Global Engineering Team).
    </h3>
    <h3>The ask was, "we have a significant need to gather, consolidate, and analyze feedback from customers, partners,
        and internal stakeholders".</h3>
    <h3>We are asking you to build a system of collecting and analyzing this feedback from a variety of sources to
        include EBCs (Equity based Compensation) and CACs (Customer acquisition cost).</h3>
    <h3>Over a 10 week period we put together an entire system, to first collect information, feedback, etc. from
        customers and parters after meetings, or at the end of the week. Then we would get that data into a spreadsheet
        and analyze it. Once we got it analyzed we would send it back to the party that needed it.</h3>
    <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
    <h3>As for personal projects, I have only done projects like coding. You can check out my github although I dont
        like to keep my projects public.</h3>
    <h3>For example one of my favorite projects was a text based adventure game built in python where you could take
        multiple paths and each one would come out with a different outcome each time. I had almost 50 differnet
        endings, 5 different enemys and weapons. And a full health and healing system.</h3>
